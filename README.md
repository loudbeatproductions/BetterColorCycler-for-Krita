# Better Color Cycler (Original)


**The problem:**
-
The built-in shortcuts to shift the color hue is too inconsistent.
The brightness of the color would drift into total darkness after enough full rotations.

It's impossible to change the color with shortcuts if saturation is 0 until you manually change it.

**The solution:**
-
This plugin adds shortcuts to enhance the ability to rotate the hue of the current foreground color,
with a fixed angle of rotation and not changing the color's saturation or brightness (value).

Additionally, you can configure how many steps (number of times the shortcuts are triggered) are needed to make a full rotation in the color wheel,
so you can choose to pick a color of a specific angle if you use a dial accessory or similar.

Example: By default, max_steps is set to 24, because the "Mini KeyDial KD100", takes 24 steps to make a full rotation.
You can edit this value in the .py file if you use similar accessories.
#
*Extra features:*

Shortcuts to adjust saturation and brightness with a fixed distance, which don't drift.

*Usage*
-
Once the plugin is installed you can configure shortcuts in krita settings, like you would with other shortcuts.

You can also change the default settings inside the .py file if you want.

#
*Relative mode:*

With any color you have currently selected, rotate the hue by a certain degree.
The default angle is 15Â° but this can be changed in the .py file.

#
*Absolute mode:*

Calibrate the accessory of choice (turn dial to 12-o'clock position, then use the shortcut to reset the counter. Then set Shortcuts 3 and 4.
